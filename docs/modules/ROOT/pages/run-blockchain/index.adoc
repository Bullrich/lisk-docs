The "Run Blockchain" category contains all the guides concerning the management of a Lisk node and is therefore especially interesting for delegates and other operators of a Lisk node.

== What is a blockchain node?

A blockchain node is a server with a running blockchain application, like xref:{url_core}[].
Nodes are usually connected to other nodes running the same blockchain application via P2P.
Together, they form the network that is maintaining the blockchain.

In DPoS, only a certain set of nodes is delegated by the network to add new blocks to the blockchain.
These nodes fulfill a very important role in the network and therefore require certain <<how-to-enable-forging-on-a-node,additional configurations>> and <<protecting-forging-nodes,security measures>>, compared to regular nodes.
Besides this, they are equal to any non-forging node in the network, and follow the same installation process.

== How to set up a Lisk Core node

Lisk Core is the blockchain application that maintains the Lisk Mainnet.

To set up Lisk Core, choose a distribution and follow the respective setup guide:

* *NPM:* xref:{url_core_setup_npm}[]
* *Binary:* xref:{url_core_setup_binary}[]
* *Snap:* xref:{url_core_setup_snap}[]
* *Docker:* xref:{url_core_setup_docker}[]
* *Source code:* xref:{url_core_setup_source}[]

== Forging nodes

A forging node is simply a node that has forging enabled for a particular delegate, who is in an active forging position.
In the Lisk Mainnet, this means exactly 103 forging nodes exist in the network for each forging round.

Forging nodes are the only nodes that can add new blocks to the blockchain.
During a forging round, every forging node has the opportunity to forge exactly one block.

NOTE: Follow the guide xref:{url_run_forging}[] to learn how to enable forging on a node for a particular delegate.

=== Forging in the Testnet

Anyone can start forging in the Lisk Testnet, thanks to the the xref:{url_faucet}[Lisk Testnet faucet^], where users can request free Testnet LSK tokens.

This makes the Lisk Testnet the perfect place for users who want to test out how the forging process works, or delegates who want to test certain forging setups before implementing them for their Mainnet delegate.

IMPORTANT: The Testnet LSK do not hold any intrinsic value, as the Lisk Testnet is a network purely for testing purposes.
They can *never* be exchanged to real LSK tokens from the Lisk Mainnet.

=== Forging in the Mainnet

If you consider gaining an active forging position on the Lisk Mainnet, please be aware that the Lisk DPoS requires to xref:{url_glossary_selfvote}[self vote] with a certain amount of your own tokens.
Therefore, a certain self-investment is required for every delegate who wishes to participate in the forging process.

==== Gaining an active forging spot

To gain a secure forging spot for a forging round, a delegate needs to be one of the top 101 delegates with the most xref:{url_glossary_delegateweight}[delegate weight] in the network, see xref:{url_protocol_voting}[Delegates, voting and delegate weight] for more information about the voting process in the Lisk Protocol.

To see the currently required thresholds for entering the top 101, check the delegate weights of the currently actively 101 forging delegates, for example in one of the public Lisk network explorers:

* *Lisk Observer:* {url_observer}[^]
* *Lisk Scan:* {url_liskscan}[^]

==== Earning rewards as standby delegate

Each forging round, two additional delegates outside the top 101 are chosen randomly to gain an active forging spot for this particular round.
This gives delegates who don't have enough vote weights the chance to profit from forging awards as well.

The random selection of the two standby delegates is proportional to their individual vote weight, maeining delegates with higher vote weight have a higher chance of getting selected.
See xref:{url_protocol_selection}[Forging delegate selection] for more information.

=== Protecting forging nodes
To keep the network healthy, and to not miss any block rewards, it is recommended to implement certain security measures to protect the forging node against attacks and/or failures.

For more information, see the guide xref:{url_run_protection_forge}[].
