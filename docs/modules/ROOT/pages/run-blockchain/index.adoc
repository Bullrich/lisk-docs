The "Run Blockchain" category contains all the guides concerning the management of a Lisk node and is therefore especially interesting for delegates and other operators of a Lisk node.

== Forging nodes

A forging node is simply a node that has forging enabled for a particular delegate who is in an active forging position.
In the Lisk Mainnet, this means exactly 103 forging nodes exist in the network for each forging round.

During a forging round, every forging node has the opportunity to forge exactly one block.

Forging nodes are the only nodes that can add new blocks to the blockchain.

=== Protecting forging nodes
To keep the network healthy, and to not miss any block rewards, it is recommended to implement certain security measures to protect the forging node against attacks and/or failures.
