=== Overview

The Lisk platform has been designed with a view to offering a complete plug and play system which is scalable, sustainable, and secure.
It provides developers with the possibility to perform all their requirements in one environment from inception, design, and development up to business adoption, and ultimately monetizing their decentralized applications.
The Lisk ecosystem has continued its exponential growth over the years and is perpetually evolving towards achieving the goal of full interoperability to third party blockchains.
Our philosophy is to reduce the learning curve for developers by offering a user-friendly SDK to program and develop apps in JavaScript.
Our value proposition consists of offering the flexibility to customize and develop sidechains, which is supported by a fully comprehensive set of online documentation including a step-by-step guide, together with all the relevant tutorials required to suit all levels of programmers from beginner to experienced level.

One of the key benefits with the Lisk network is that it utilises the highly efficient delegated proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, which is secured by democratically elected delegates, which in turn results in significantly lower energy consumption.
Finally, to further bolster the Lisk products range, Lisk will very soon be launching the new Lisk Decentralized Exchange (DEX), in addition to a new fiat on ramp facility which will allow users to exchange fiat currency for LSK tokens.
A brief overview of the key products is described below, which have all been designed and built with the same philosophy in mind to simultaneously offer user-friendly products to enable developers to build and develop their apps.




=== Lisk Software Development Kit (SDK)

The Lisk SDK has been designed and built to provide a use-friendly open-source software development kit.
The SDK offers developers the possibility to build scalable blockchain applications in JavaScript.
and offers the flexibility to run them on their own customized blockchain.
The SDK uses both Javascript and TypeScript and deploys the highly efficient and scalable DPoS consensus mechanism, the Lisk DPoS, and also the BFT (Byzantine-Fault-Tolerance), mechanism.
One of the key benefits of the Lisk SDK is it is completely modular, allowing the possibility to configure, exchange or extend any of the blockchain-related logic in the application with Modules and assets, and Plugins.
