=== Introduction - The basics of blockchain
The term blockchain can be easily defined as a structure that has the ability to store transactional records. This method of storage is often referred to as a 'digital ledger'. It can be further broken down into 'blocks' which refer to how the data is stored, and then into 'chains' which pertains to the blocks of data being linked together in a permanent 'chain', resulting in a 'blockchain' +
The benefits of using this structure are that at its core, it is a shared and immutable ledger that enables transactions to be recorded, and assets to be tracked. Furthermore, with this technology it is possible to track any item of value, and also trade it on a blockchain network, which in turn offers numerous benefits, such as reducing the costs and risk for all parties, to name just a few.

=== What is a block?

Firstly, as can be seen in the illustration below, a blockchain essentially consists  of a chain of blocks all containing information. Each individual block contains several components. However, to simplify this and give an initial high-level overview, these can roughly be characterized into the block header and the transaction list, (data). +
The very first block in the chain is known as the Genesis block, and each new block is always linked to the preceding block.

Essentially, a blockchain is a database that is shared across multiple computers. Centralized databases can also be shared between multiple computers as well, however, one of the key advantages of blockchain is that the power of altering this shared database does not lay in the hands of a central authority, instead it is governed by a network of machines, or nodes. In this network, the nodes are competing to add new blocks to the chain, by rules defined in the consensus algorithm. This will be explained in more detail further in this section. +
In general, the key attributes of blockchain technology are decentralization, accountability, and security, which also results in operational efficiency and significant cost savings. +
As is more than evident today, the design, construction, and utilization of applications built on blockchain architecture are increasing exponentially.

To summarize at this point, the blockchain is a distributed ledger (which can be public or private), is decentralized, and each block can contain numerous different kinds of transactions. Blockchains utilize what is known as a distributed peer-to-peer network (often called a P2P network), which allows all users to connect to this network. Once entering this network, the user will have access to a full copy of the blockchain. +
As the network may consist of many computers all connected globally, each connected computer is known as a node.
This P2P network is made up of many nodes, and one of the key advantages of such a blockchain network, is that the data contained in the blocks cannot be altered without the consensus of the entire network, (each separate node).

=== How does a blockchain transaction work?

Before delving more deeply into the intricacies of how blockchain works, it is helpful to understand the key overall concept here, which can be broken down into the following consecutive points: +
====
. *A transaction is sent*:
Once a transaction is sent, every node (computer), connected to the blockchain network is informed about it.
. *The validation process*:
The transaction is then validated by each node connected to the network. The transaction validation is confirmed via a consensus protocol, which basically requires the nodes to relay this information to each other.
. *The verification process*:
It is then verified by checking how many blocks now exist on top of the validated block. In other words, the block of data containing the transaction (this is also known as block confirmation), will then be added to the distributed ledger, which completes the verification.
. *The block creation*:
The verified transaction is now visible on the ledger as a permanent block of data. All transactions that were included within the block, such as the sender, the receiver, the relevant data (e.g. the token/coin amount), the timestamp, and other technical criteria (which will be covered further in this section), are now present in this block, which cannot be altered, modified, replaced, or removed. Hence, it is now immutable, and the transaction is completed.
====

=== Immutability

Immutability is classed as one of the key advantages of blockchain and this is made possible by the deployment of cryptographic hashes. The key benefit here is that a hash cannot be reverse-engineered, so the very nature of cryptographic hashes means that it is virtually immune to being hacked, altered, or any other malfeasance. One of the most common and popular hash functions is known as the Secure Hash Algorithm, more commonly referred to as SHA-256.

The contents of each block, e.g. the transactions are created using a cryptographic hash function. This basically consists of an alphanumeric string that is generated by each block individually. Every block contains a hash value for its respective data, and also for the previous block. This enables and ensures the blocks are subsequently coupled (chained), together.

This functionality is the definition of immutability and ensures the data already saved in each block is tamper-free, and cannot be interfered with. As can be seen in the more detailed diagram below the hash functions are linked together.
Finally, some of the benefits here consist of increased efficiency, coupled with complete data integrity. This leads in to the next topics of decentralization and consensus which are also important to understand how a whole blockchain functions.

=== Decentralization

All completed transactions are recorded in a chronological manner, subsequently all of these blocks in the blockchain are then distributed across all the nodes within the network, and therefore the blockchain is accessible by all nodes, as it does not exist in any one specific location. +
A decentralized network basically consists of a number of nodes (computers), that are independently connected on a peer-to-peer basis (also known as P2P).
Decentralization is not actually a new concept and consists of 3 architectural types: decentralized, distributed, and centralized as shown in the illustration below:

// .Decentralized architecture

Naturally, there are pros and cons with respect to all 3 architectures, however, we will focus more on the decentralized architecture which pertains more to blockchain technologies.
All new transactions that occur within the network simultaneously update every fully participating node in the network ecosystem regardless of their location.

=== Consensus

It is important to understand consensus within the blockchain ecosystem. Basically, a consensus mechanism is a methodology deployed by nodes to agree on, and validate the data content of a block before it becomes part of a blockchain. The block containing this data is then distributed to all the nodes within the network. The consensus algorithm is responsible for ensuring that only 1 copy of the data encapsulated in each block exists within each node.

Various consensus mechanisms exist today, however the 3 main mechanisms that are widely used consist of the Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, and Delegated-Proof-of-Stake mechanisms, which are explained below:

=== Proof-of-Work (PoW)
Proof of Work is probably the most well-known and established consensus mechanism, as it is utilized by Bitcoin. However, when compared to the other consensus mechanisms, it is somewhat inefficient as it requires a high amount of energy and processing power to reach a consensus, thus being rather cumbersome and expensive to operate. Basically to validate transactions it requires the nodes to solve an arbitrary mathematical problem or complex equations, which prevents the network being hacked, and also provides a high level of security. It is also widely used for mining cryptocurrencies and minting new tokens.

=== Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
To explain PoS briefly, it allows the users to stake an asset/token which in turn opens up the possibility to be chosen as a validator of a new block, which then allows transaction fees, or newly minted tokens to be collected from the block as a reward. Staking is defined as an amount of tokens/assets that are held by the node. The proof-of-stake-mechanism uses a random algorithm for consensus building and eliminates the need for complex mathematical calculations, hence reducing the overall computing power and enery required. Alternatively, the nodes that hold the most tokens/assets have the power to validate the transactions, which in turn results in this node receiving a reward, usually in newly minted tokens.


=== Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)

DPoS works in a similar fashion to PoS, however one of the key advantages is that it utilizes a delegation and voting mechanism, which in turn incentivizes the users to use their staked collateral to secure the network. To allow this mechanism to be both efficient and effective at performing transaction validations, various different components of delegated proof of stake exist. Ultimately, the DPoS is considered the most advantageous mechanism here, as it was designed to negate most of the limitations that exist with PoW and PoS. This consensus algorithm used in DPoS utilizes a unique election system that is able to select nodes which are able to perform block verification.
In this system, generally  delegates are voted in based upon their reputation. Each user who holds a minimum of one token/coin with the DPoS blockchain has the ability to vote specifically for the nodes that they want to perform the transaction validations.
This is the consensus mechanism used by Lisk, and hence every Lisk holder is able to vote for delegates, and dependent on these votes, certain delegates are allowed to add blocks to the blockchain in a specific order. The delegates are actually normal Lisk accounts that have performed a delegate registration transaction. +
The whole process can be considered as the most democratic method of voting, as it does not rest on the users that possess the highest amount of tokens, as just because a particular user has many tokens, that does not authorize this user to validate and confirm transactions. All the users that maintain tokens in their accounts are able to select a group of delegates to perform this task. Furthermore, the DPoS has the advantage of being able to execute transactions and verifications much faster, which results in higher scalability.

Now the basics of blockchain have been explained, the following section will delve into further detail and explain how a blockchain works.
