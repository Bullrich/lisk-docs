=== Introduction - The basics of blockchain
The term blockchain can be easily defined as a structure that has the ability to store transactional records. This method of storage is often referred to as a 'digital ledger'. It can be further broken down into 'blocks' which refer to how the data is stored, and then into 'chains' which pertains to the blocks of data being linked together in a permanent 'chain', resulting in a 'blockchain' +
The benefits of using this structure are that at its core, it is a shared and immutable ledger that enables transactions to be recorded, and assets to be tracked. Furthermore, with this technology it is possible to track any item of value, and also trade it on a blockchain network, which in turn offers numerous benefits, such as reducing the costs and risk for all parties, to name just a few.

=== What is a block?

Firstly, as can be seen in the illustration below, a blockchain essentially consists  of a chain of blocks all containing information. Each individual block contains several components. However, to simplify this and give an initial high-level overview, these can roughly be characterized into the block header and the transaction list, (data). +
The very first block in the chain is known as the Genesis block, and each new block is always linked to the preceding block.

Essentially, a blockchain is a database that is shared across multiple computers. +
In general, the key attributes of blockchain technology are decentralization, accountability, and security, which also results in operational efficiency and significant cost savings. +
As is more than evident today, the design, construction, and utilization of applications built on blockchain architecture are increasing exponentially.

To summarize at this point, the blockchain is a distributed ledger (which can be public or private), is decentralized, and each block can contain numerous different kinds of transactions. Blockchains utilize what is known as a distributed peer-to-peer network (often called a P2P network), which allows all users to connect to this network. Once entering this network, the user will have access to a full copy of the blockchain. +
As the network may consist of many computers all connected globally, each connected computer is known as a node.
This P2P network is made up of many nodes, and one of the key advantages of such a blockchain network, is that the data contained in the blocks cannot be altered without the consensus of the entire network, (each separate node).

=== How does a blockchain transaction work?

Before delving more deeply into the intricacies of how blockchain works, it is helpful to understand the key overall concept here, which can be broken down into the following consecutive points: +
====
. *A transaction is sent*:
Once a transaction is sent, every node (computer), connected to the blockchain network is informed about it. 
. *The validation process*:
The transaction is then validated by each node connected to the network.
. *The verification process*:
After every node on the network has verified the transaction, the block of data (containing the transaction), will then be added to the distributed ledger.
. *Block creation*:
The verified transaction is now visible on the ledger as a block of data. All of the transactions that were included within the block, such as the sender, the receiver, the relevant data (e.g. the token/coin amount), the timestamp, and other technical criteria (which will be covered further in this section), are now present in this block.
. *Joining the chain*:
This block is now added permanently to the blockchain, whereby it cannot be altered, modified, replaced, or removed. Hence, it becomes completely immutable.
. *Transaction completed*:
The transaction is now completed, and this block will remain permanently in the blockchain.
====
All completed transactions are recorded in a chronological manner, which in turn results in an immutable chain. This ‘ledger’ which in reality is a  number of blocks chained together, and as mentioned is known as a blockchain. +
All of these blocks in the blockchain are then distributed across all the nodes within the network, and therefore the blockchain is accessible by all nodes, as it does not exist in any one specific location. +
All new transactions (blocks), that occur within the network simultaneously update every fully participating node in the network ecosystem regardless of their location, so this results in what is known as a decentralized system. +
Finally, the contents of a block could represent data and transactions of many types. For example, this could be currencies/tokens, identity, digital rights, intellectual property, and many more different types. +
Now the basics of blockchain have been explained, the following section will delve into further detail and explain how a blockchain works.
