The term blockchain can be easily defined as a structure that has the ability to store transactional records. This method of storage is often referred to as a 'digital ledger'. +
The benefits of using this structure are that at its core, it is a shared and immutable ledger that enables transactions to be recorded, and assets to be tracked. Furthermore, with this technology it is possible to track any item of value, and also trade it on a blockchain network, which in turn reduces the costs and risk for all parties.

Firstly, as can be seen in the illustration below, a blockchain essentially consists  of a chain of blocks all containing information.
The very first block in the chain is known as the Genesis block,and each new block is linked to the preceding block.

Essentially, a blockchain is a database that is shared across multiple computers. +
In general, the key attributes of blockchain technology are decentralization, accountability, and security, which also results in operational efficiency and significant cost savings. As is more than evident today, the design, construction, and utilization of applications built on blockchain architecture are increasing exponentially.

To summarize, the blockchain is a distributed ledger (which can be public or private), is decentralized, and each block can contain numerous different kinds of transactions. Blockchains utilize what is known as a distributed peer-to-peer network (often called a P2P network), which allows all users to connect to this network. Once entering this network, the user will have access to a full copy of the blockchain. +
As the network may comprise of many computers all connected globally, each connected computer is known as a node. +
This P2P network is made up of many nodes, and one of the key advantages of such a blockchain network, is that the data contained in the blocks cannot be altered without the consensus of the entire network, (each separate node).
