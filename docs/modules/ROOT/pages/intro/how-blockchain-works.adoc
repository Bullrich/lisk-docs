=== Overview
As described on the previous page from a high-level perspective blockchain is basically a 'digital ledger' which has many functionalities and use cases.
It can also be thought of as a digital methodology to store data, whereby the data is encapsulated in blocks, and once the blocks are chained together they cannot be changed or altered, thus making them immutable. +
Once a block of data is added to the blockchain it will remain publicly viewable to anyone at anytime. This is a highly beneficial system as it enables permanent records to be kept, enabling the storage of almost any type of record. For example, it could be virtually anything such as medical records, financial transactions, property rights, etc. +

To start to break down how the blockchain works, and before we delve into the detailed contents of a block, firstly we need to understand how the blocks are linked together, this is accomplished by using cryptography. Therefore, each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, the transaction data,  and a timestamp. This will be explained in more detail further in this section. +
As previously mentioned once created, the blocks are immutable and cannot be changed retroactively. The only way this could be achieved would be by altering the subsequential blocks, which would require the consensus of the entire network.

=== Key characteristics of blockchain

There are four core characteristics attributed to the blockchain which are covered below:

* Decentralization – The contents of each block in the blockchain can be accessed by any node on the network, as they are essentially network copies present on all participating nodes. Therefore, there is no central entity that holds each block in the chain, so this creates decentralization. +

* Consensus Driven – A consensus model independently verifies each block on the blockchain, and provides certain rules for validating a block, which may utilise key resources such as computing power, in order to demonstrate that this has been accomplished. For example, with regard to Bitcoin this is known as the mining process. +
There are different types of consensus models which will be covered further in this section, however suffice to say that a consensus model is able to function independently, and does not require any form of central authority.

* Immutability – A blockchain can be considered as a permanent, unchangeable, and irreversible record of transactions. Hence, once a block is created and added to the blockchain it ensures the transaction is completely trustable.

* Transparency – A blockchain by its very nature provides total open transparency. A full transaction history  can be viewed by any party as it is in effect an open file. Therefore, another highly beneficial advantage is that a blockchain creates provenance, as all transactions can be easily audited from the first to the last entry.

// To secure its blockchain and keep its distributed network of computers in sync, Lisk uses a consensus system called delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS). DPoS leverages a real-time voting system to determine which computers running the software can create the next block on the Lisk blockchain.
