A consensus protocol is the protocol for validators{fn_validators} to **agree on one chain of blocks**.
In particular, the consensus protocol defines, when a block and all included transactions are **final**, i.e., irrevocably deemed part of the blockchain.

== Consensus protocols in Lisk

Blockchain applications built with the Lisk SDK achieve consensus in all important domains via dedicated modules, which each cover a specific aspect of the overall consensus of a blockchain.

TIP: There are multiple available protocols for the consensus domain `Block proposal` that you can choose from, to fit the specific use case.

|Consensus domain|Consensus protocol|Responsible for

|Block proposal
|xref:{url_understand_dpos}[Lisk DPoS] or xref:{url_understand_poa}[Lisk PoA]
|* **Choosing validators**: Deciding who can be validator, i.e. who is allowed to add new blocks to the blockchain.
* **Block frequency**: Defining when a block is added to the chain.

|Agreement on one chain
|xref:{url_understand_bft}[Lisk BFT]
|* **Fork{fn_fork} prevention**: Determining how validators choose the chain to which they add a new block.
* **Chain finalization**: Determining when a block (and all included transactions) is irrevocably deemed part of the blockchain.

|Cross-chain{fn_crosschain} agreement
|xref:{url_understand_interop}[Lisk Interoperability]
|* **Verifying cross-chain communication**: Attesting the correctness of cross-chain messages with certificates.
* **Chain of trust for validators **: Attesting updates about the current validator set of a chain in certificates.
