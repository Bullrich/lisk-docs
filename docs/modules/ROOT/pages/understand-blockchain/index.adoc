Start to learn the basics of blockchain applications, including how they are structured and which rules, terms and concepts are important to know when developing an own blockchain application with Lisk.

This section introduces the main concepts of the Lisk protocol.

== The three domains of a blockchain

At a very high level, there are three domains of a blockchain:

=== State machine

Every blockchain is at its core a {wiki_dfsm}[deterministic finite-state machine^].

A state machine is a computer science concept whereby a machine can have multiple states, but only one at any given time. There is a state, which describes the current state of the system, and transactions, that trigger state transitions.



=== Consensus

=== Network

The state tree is the sparse Merkle tree built on top of the state store.
Organizing the state of a blockchain in a Merkle tree allows to cryptographically authenticate the whole state with a single hash, the state root.
The state root property is calculated at the end of the block processing as the Merkle root of the state tree and included in the block header.
Information from the block header is then used to create a certificate and signed by the chain validators.
