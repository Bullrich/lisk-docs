Learn the basics of blockchain applications, including how they are structured and which rules, terms and concepts are important to know when developing an own blockchain application with Lisk.

This section introduces the main concepts of the Lisk protocol.

== The three domains of a blockchain

At a very high level, there are three domains of a blockchain:

xref:{url_understand_state_machine}[State machine domain]: Responsible for transitioning the blockchain state with deterministic logic.
xref:{url_understand_state_machine}[Consensus domain]: Responsible for the replication of the same sequence of states among all nodes in the network.
This is achieved by nodes in the network following a xref:{url_intro_consensus}[consensus protocol] and utilizing the state machine and network domains.
xref:{url_understand_state_machine}[Network domain]:: Responsible for the communication of the peer-to-peer network.
