The quickest way to bootstrap a blockchain application with the Lisk SDK is explained here.

== Supported Operating Systems

The Lisk SDK will run on both the Ubuntu and MacOS operating systems listed below:

[tabs]

=====
Ubuntu::
+
--
* 18.04 (LTS)
* 20.04 (LTS)
--
MacOS::
+
--
* 10.13 (High Sierra)
* 10.14 (Mojave)
* 10.15 (Catalina)

NOTE: Please note that the SDK does not come with any official support for Windows.

== Dependencies

The following dependencies need to be installed to run the Lisk SDK:

[options="header",]
|===
|Dependencies |Version
|Git | v2 (latest)
|Node.js | v12.22.9 (NPM version 6.14.15)
|Lisk Commander | v5.1.7 (latest)
|===

=== Node.js

If you are using NVM, (Node.js Version Manager), ensure you install the correct version as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install v12.22.9
----

NOTE: The correct version for NPM(6) is installed automatically with version 12 of Node.js.

=== Lisk Commander

It is recommended to install Lisk Commander globally with NPM (Node Package Manager), to facilitate the convenient usage of the Lisk Commander CLI.

[source,bash]
----
npm install --global lisk-commander
----

== Project setup

[source,bash]
----
mkdir hello_app
cd hello_app
----

.hello_app/
[source,bash]
----
lisk init
----

The user is asked for the application name, description, author, and license after running `lisk init`.

Next, all the required files are created by Lisk Commander.
----
Using template "lisk-ts"
Initializing git repository
Updating .liskrc.json file
Creating project structure
? Application name hello_app
? Application description My blockchain application
? Author mona
? License ISC
----

== Start the application

Execute the following command to start the blockchain application.

.hello_app/
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run start
----

To verify that the application has started, check the log messages in the terminal.
If the start was successful, the application will enable forging for all genesis delegates and will begin adding new blocks to the blockchain every 10 seconds.

NOTE: The xref:{url_references_cli}[application CLI] offers various commands to conveniently manage your blockchain application.

To see an overview of all the available CLI commands, execute the following commands in the root folder of the application:

.hello_app/
[source,bash]
----
./bin/run --help
----

== Using the application CLI globally

To use the application commands globally, create an alias in the `.bashrc` file.

.~/.bashrc/
[source,bash]
----
alias hello_app="$HOME/hello_app/bin/run" # <1>
----

<1> Adjust to the path where your `hello_app` is located.

After updating the `.bashrc` file, make it directly available in the terminal by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
. ~/.bashrc
----

Now it is possible to conveniently run the application CLI commands from anywhere by referring to the alias.

[source,bash]
----
hello_app --help
----
